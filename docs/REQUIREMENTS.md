## Code Organization Best Practices

### File Structure
- Create small and focused files
- Break down large files into multiple smaller modules
- Each file should have a single, clear responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into separate utility files

### Component Organization
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Use hooks for reusable logic
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex logic into utility functions

### Data Management
- Centralize mock data in dedicated files
- Use TypeScript interfaces for data models
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache data where appropriate
